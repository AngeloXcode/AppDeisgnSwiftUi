# Launch Screen with SwiftUI

## Try to suing swiftUI to Build Launch Screen by usin @AppStorage

## What is @AppStorage ?
     SwiftUI has a dedicated property wrapper for reading values from UserDefaults, which will automatically reinvoke
     your view’s body property when the value changes. That is, this wrapper effectively watches a key in UserDefaults, 
     and will refresh your UI if that key changes.


## Important: @AppStorage writes your data to UserDefaults, which is not secure storage. As a result, you should not save any personal data using @AppStorage, because it’s relatively easy to extract.
